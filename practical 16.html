<p > Nature is full of wonders and gifts for people. These natural wonders include flowing rivers, thundering waterfalls, dancing breezes, smiling flowers, and high mountains, to name a few. Nature has the power to provide us true joy, goodness, and happiness. Every element of nature is as alive to someone who appreciates it as a living thing. Wordsworth stated that “there is a spirit in the woods” for this reason.
There are countless natural beauties. Yet sadly, the modern man is too preoccupied with material things. He is too preoccupied to appreciate the wonders of nature. He doesn’t have time to play with the dancing daffodils, watch the clouds move majestically across the sky, or listen to the birds sing.Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planet’s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.
